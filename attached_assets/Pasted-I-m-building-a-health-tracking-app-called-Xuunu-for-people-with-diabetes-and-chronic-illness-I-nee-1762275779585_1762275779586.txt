I'm building a health tracking app called Xuunu for people with diabetes and chronic illness. 
I need you to create a complete, working React Native app using Expo that I can test on my phone TODAY.

CORE FUNCTIONALITY:

1. USER AUTHENTICATION (Firebase)
   - Email/password sign up and login
   - Google sign-in
   - Password reset
   - Persistent login (remember user)
   - Clean, simple auth screens

2. HOME SCREEN (Main Dashboard)
   - Welcome message with user's name
   - Today's date
   - Quick stats: "Last logged X hours ago"
   - Current environmental conditions for user's location:
     * Air Quality Index (AQI) with color coding (green=good, yellow=moderate, red=unhealthy)
     * Temperature and "feels like"
     * Humidity percentage
     * Weather description
   - Large "Log Health Data" button
   - Recent entries list (last 3 entries as cards)

3. LOG HEALTH SCREEN
   - Date/time picker (defaults to now)
   - Blood glucose input (number, mg/dL)
   - Overall symptom severity slider (1-10)
   - Checkboxes for common symptoms:
     * Fatigue
     * Pain
     * Brain Fog
     * Nausea
     * Headache
     * Other
   - Notes field (multi-line text, optional)
   - Location input (zip code or city name)
   - "Save Entry" button
   - Show loading state while saving
   - Success message after save
   - Save to Firebase Firestore

4. HISTORY SCREEN
   - List of all logged entries (newest first)
   - Each entry shows:
     * Date/time
     * Glucose level with units
     * Symptom severity (1-10)
     * Weather conditions that day
     * Location
   - Tap entry to see full details
   - Last 7 days visible (free tier)
   - "Upgrade to Premium" banner for unlimited history

5. INSIGHTS SCREEN
   - Simple correlations based on logged data:
     * Average glucose by air quality level
     * Symptom severity vs AQI
     * Best/worst days summary
   - If <10 entries: "Log more data to see patterns"
   - If 10+ entries: Show basic statistics
   - "AI Insights (Premium)" section (locked for now)

6. PROFILE SCREEN
   - User email
   - Account created date
   - Default location (save zip code)
   - "Logout" button
   - "About Xuunu" section
   - "Contact Support" link

TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:

- Use Expo SDK 50 or latest
- Firebase (v10+):
  * Authentication (email/password + Google)
  * Firestore database
  * Set up with my Firebase config (I'll provide)
- React Navigation v6 (bottom tabs):
  * Home (house icon)
  * Log (plus icon)  
  * History (list icon)
  * Insights (chart icon)
  * Profile (person icon)
- React Native Paper for UI components (consistent design)
- Environmental data: OpenWeather API
  * Air Quality (AQI, PM2.5, PM10)
  * Current weather
  * I'll provide API key
- Async Storage: Save user preferences locally
- Expo Location: Get user's coordinates (with permission)

DESIGN REQUIREMENTS:

- Clean, modern, calming design
- Color scheme: 
  * Primary: #4A90E2 (blue)
  * Success: #7ED321 (green)
  * Warning: #F5A623 (orange)
  * Danger: #D0021B (red)
  * Background: #F8F9FA (light gray)
- Large, tappable buttons (accessibility)
- Good spacing (padding: 16-24px)
- Smooth transitions
- Loading states for all async operations
- Error handling with friendly messages
- Works on both iOS and Android

DATA STRUCTURE (Firestore):

users/{userId}/
  - email
  - displayName
  - defaultLocation (zip code)
  - createdAt
  - isPremium (boolean, default: false)

users/{userId}/entries/{entryId}/
  - timestamp
  - glucose (number)
  - symptomSeverity (1-10)
  - symptoms (array)
  - notes (string)
  - location (string)
  - environmental {
      aqi: number,
      temp: number,
      humidity: number,
      weather: string,
      pm25: number
    }

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:

1. Code must be complete and working - no TODOs or placeholders
2. Include all necessary dependencies in package.json
3. Handle errors gracefully (network failures, API errors, etc)
4. Loading states for all API calls
5. Optimize for performance (minimize re-renders)
6. Comment complex logic
7. Use TypeScript if possible, JavaScript is fine too
8. Follow React Native best practices
9. Ensure app works offline (with cached data)
10. Clear instructions for:
    - Setting up Firebase config
    - Adding OpenWeather API key
    - Testing on phone via Expo Go

ADDITIONAL FEATURES (If Time):

- Pull-to-refresh on history screen
- Search/filter entries by date
- Export data to CSV
- Dark mode toggle
- Biometric login (fingerprint/Face ID)

START WITH:

1. Set up navigation structure
2. Create Firebase configuration placeholder
3. Build authentication flow
4. Build home screen with API integration
5. Build logging screen with form validation
6. Set up Firestore data flow
7. Build other screens
8. Polish UI and add loading states
9. Test all flows work properly

Please create the complete file structure and all code needed to run this app. 
Make it production-quality, not a prototype.

I want to test this on my iPhone using Expo Go within 2-3 hours.

Let's build this.
